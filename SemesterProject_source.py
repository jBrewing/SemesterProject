# This script is a general visualization tool used in conjunction with
# the ongoing water-related-energy study, under the CUASHI research
# umbrella, focusing on the Living & Learning Community at Utah State.
# Based on input, it queries an InfluxDB database, where
# water consumption data and associated water temperature data are stored.
# Based on user input, the script performs a variety of tasks, including:
#   - comparison of water-related energy use between buildings
#   - outputs a variety of visualizations for water-related energy use
#   - performs some basic statistical analysis on water-related energy use.
